Project overview

task: create a small custom dashboard UI that will that could be used by a customer that shows items in a list (think newegg, best buy etc)
utilizes data from an API call to get this data and parse it
the API call will be JSON data returned


requirements:
dashboard should have these things at least:
		- a filter dropdown (sorting)
		- a card list of items (picture, price, sales if any)
		- search within these results

Visually
		- Should have a header, footer, and main section
			- header should have logo
			- footer needs generic link list, social media, etc (privacy policy, contact us, etc)
		- should be able to be responsive, mobile first ideally
		- navigation with 3 links ideally (can be psuedo)


Good-to-haves:
		- pagination of results - maybe 10 per page
		- quickview popup of this item
